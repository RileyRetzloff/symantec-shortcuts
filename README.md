# symantec-shortcuts

### Priority TODOs

### Other TODOs

-   speed up downloadAllIncidents implementation (all files download at once?)
-   implement 'hover over image file to preview'

### Done

-   implement 'dismiss + next incident + download files' shortcut
-   fix downloadAllFiles() not being reached (presumably due to page refresh) inside dismissAndAdvance()
-   figure out why 'back' shortcut isn't working
-   downloadAllFiles() is reachable, but doesn't always engage
