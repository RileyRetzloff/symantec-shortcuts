# symantec-shortcuts

### Priority TODOs

-   fix downloadAllFiles() not being reached (presumably due to page refresh) inside dismissAndAdvance()
-   Chrome doesn't allow more than 4 "commands". currently 5 commands are defined in the manifest, so the extension cannot even be loaded.

### Other TODOs

-   figure out why 'back' shortcut isn't working
-   speed up downloadAllIncidents implementation (all files download at once?)
-   implement 'hover over image file to preview'

### Done

-   implement 'dismiss + next incident + download files' shortcut
